# Personal Website

My personal website is a digital portfolio of the work I have accomplished since pursuing a career in web development. This website uses React as a framework to develop a highly-performant, single-page web application. 

Through this website users can learn a little bit about me, view my recent works, contact me through an email form, and view my resume and technological proficiencies.

A link to the deployed application can be found here: [glendonintendo.github.io](https://glendonintendo.github.io/).
